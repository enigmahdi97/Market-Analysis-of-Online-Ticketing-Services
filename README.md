## Context of the case study
Sunrise is strong global telecom player and have invested in Wakanda 10 years back to establish the country’s first cell phone service company. However, as of now they have near to ~30% of the market share and are facing stiff competition from the new entrant Crono – also a global player (though fairly new) who specializes in embracing disruptive business models especially in e-commerce.
Being on the crux of technological revolution, travel and ticketing industry in Wakanda is also on the brink of experiencing a staggering shift. Even though most of the Wakandians still prefer paper based tickets sold at different counters making this industry stand at USD 2 billion per year (ref: LightCastle Primary Research, 2017), trend shows online ticketing (currently accounts only for 7% of the pie) will soon pick up and pose a disruptive challenge to this traditional form of ticketing.
Seeing this as an opportunity Crono has invested in an online ticketing business called hoza who is currently the market leader. Other significant players in the market are Wktickets and BusWK. Word in the market is that Sunrise the vintage telecom giant in Wakanda is also exploring to enter the market.
